Predicting churn is an increasingly important subject, especially as more companies adopt subscription-based business models, such as Netflix, Spotify, and various software companies. This trend is also evident in sectors like banking and insurance, where customer retention can significantly impact profitability. Understanding and mitigating churn in these industries can lead to enhanced customer loyalty and improved financial performance.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning solution to predict whether a customer will unsubscribe (churn). Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Identifying clients who are more likely to churn is crucial, as it allows the company to focus on those customers and implement targeted strategies to retain them.

The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service.
